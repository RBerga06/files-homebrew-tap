MIDJUNGARDS is an amply ﬁctitious Gothic hand script. Beside my interest in history, language and culture of the ancient Goths, I’m a great friend of J. R. R. TOLKIEN’s œuvre—and in the intersection of both now lies this font. It is modelled on the italic style of the Elven script Tengwar. The name Midjungards (goth. “world”) follows the name of TOLKIEN’s fantasy continent, “Middle Earth”, which in turn is obviously derived from the Germanic “Midgard” (as TOLKIEN’s world borrows many a motif from European mythology and history).

This typeface contains 110 characters. To allow writing in programmes that don’t support the high Gothic Unicode range (as for example MS Word), the Gothic characters are mapped to the Latin range as well. And in order to render texts in Midjungards that distinguish between upper and lower case letters, this font’s latin majuscules and minuscules are equally mapped with Gothic glyphs. Finally, to achieve a neat sequence of letters, it is highly recommended that kerning and ligatures be turned on.

MIDJUNGARDS may be used freely for non commercial purposes. For commercial use, please contact me.
